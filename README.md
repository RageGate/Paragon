# Paragon
*Paragon* is an addon that adds reputation information to reputation related items in the game. It also lets you keep track of reputations for all your characters, primarily via tooltips.

## Item Tooltips
Paragon can display your current standing with a reputation on reputation related items. It can also show your other character's standings directly in the tooltip! It has never been easier to figure out which alt to send that Dreamweavers Insignia to.

## Reputation Listing

Paragon can also list your character's reputation standings with any reputation via the slash command `/par <faction>`

For example, type `/par armies of legionfall` in chat to list each of your character's reputation status with Armies of Legionfall.
